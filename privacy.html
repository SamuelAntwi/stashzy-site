    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <section class="doc">
    <p>Stashzy (“we”, “our”, “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Stashzy mobile application and related services (the “App”) handle information when you use Stashzy.</p>
    <p>If you have questions, contact us at: <strong><a href="mailto:appsupport@0224solutions.com">appsupport@0224solutions.com</a></strong></p>

    <h2>1) What Stashzy does</h2>
    <p>Stashzy helps you organise and track items in your home inventory (e.g., household items, appliances, wardrobe, supplies), including optional photos, notes, categories, and replacement reminders.</p>

    <h2>2) Information you provide</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inventory content:</strong> item names, categories, notes, purchase/acquisition dates, values, quantities, replacement dates, warranty info (if you enter it).</li>
      <li><strong>Photos:</strong> images you take or select to attach to items.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional metadata:</strong> brand, model, serial number, or location within your home (only if you choose to add it).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Stashzy is designed to work without requiring you to create an account (unless you enable optional account/cloud features in a future version).</p>

    <h2>3) Information we collect automatically</h2>
    <p>We aim to collect as little as possible. The App may collect limited technical data to keep things working and improve stability, such as device/app information and crash/performance data.</p>

    <h2>4) How your data is stored</h2>
    <p><strong>Local-first design:</strong> Your inventory data and photos are stored on your device by default.</p>
    <p>If Stashzy later offers optional cloud sync/backup, this policy will be updated to clearly explain what data is synced, where it is stored, how it is protected, and how you can disable it.</p>

    <h2>5) Permissions (Camera / Photos)</h2>
    <p>Stashzy may request access to Camera (to take item photos) and Photo Library (to select item photos). You can control these permissions in iOS Settings at any time.</p>

    <h2>6) How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core features (inventory tracking, photos, reminders)</li>
      <li>Maintain app functionality and security</li>
      <li>Improve performance and fix bugs</li>
      <li>Provide customer support if you contact us</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Sharing your information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We only share information with service providers for app operations (under safeguards), for legal reasons, or during business changes (with notice for material changes).</p>

    <h2>8) Analytics and tracking</h2>
    <p>Stashzy is designed to avoid invasive tracking. If tracking requiring consent is introduced, we will request your permission first.</p>

    <h2>9) Data retention</h2>
    <p>Because your inventory is stored on-device by default, it remains until you delete it, delete the app, or reset your device. Technical logs (if any) are kept only as long as needed.</p>

    <h2>10) Your choices and controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Edit or delete inventory items anytime</li>
      <li>Remove photos from items</li>
      <li>Delete the App to remove locally stored data</li>
      <li>Control Camera/Photos permissions in iOS Settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11) Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect information. No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure, but we aim to use appropriate safeguards.</p>

    <h2>12) Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>Stashzy is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>13) International users</h2>
    <p>If you use Stashzy outside the UK, your information may be processed in the country where you use your device and where our service providers operate (if applicable).</p>

    <h2>14) Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. We will update the date above and provide notice for material changes.</p>
